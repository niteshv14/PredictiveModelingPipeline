# PredictiveModelingPipeline
This repository contains the workflow for building a predictive model using a manually created 5000-row dataset. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation. The final deliverable is a concise report summarizing the process, insights, and model performance.


Key Components:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, feature engineering, and scaling.
EDA: Statistical analysis and visualization.
Model Building: Selection, training, and tuning of machine learning models.
Model Evaluation: Performance metrics and validation.
