# PredictiveModelingPipeline
This repository contains the workflow for building a predictive model using a manually created 5000-row dataset. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation. The final deliverable is a concise report summarizing the process, insights, and model performance.
